   * stored. The following have been attempted without success:
   *
   * - Looping through the provided roles and setting each one as query
   *   condition, i.e. @code $query->condition('roles', $role, '=') @endcode
   *
   * - Creating an OR or AND condition group and performing the above, i.e.
   *   @code $query->orConditionGroup() @endcode or
   *   @code $query->andConditionGroup() @endcode
   *
   * @todo Look at the Views user role filter SQL when choosing "Is all of" and
   *   setting multiple roles as a possible solution.
   *
   * @todo Determine if caching this is a good idea, or if Drupal's existing
   *   entity caching is fast enough to make that not worth the effort.
   *
   * @todo This needs tests to verify that it continues to work as expected,
   *   especially due to the potential security issues.
